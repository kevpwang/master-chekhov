# master-chekhov

###  A project for the WHRB Classical Music Department

Tired of wasting time ctrl-F'ing in Google Sheets? Want to actually find pieces by Alban Berg when you type "Berg"? This project is a fast & legitimately functional way to search the Master Chekhov.

Work in progress. Currently usable only in RStudio (clone the repo and run search.R).
